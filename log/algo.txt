Face Following:
1. detect faces in current frame, and choose the biggest one to track
2. in following frames
   - track the face
   - see if we lose track of the face, yes -> goto step 1
   - move the face to the center of the frame

Face Detection:
use Cascade Classifier and Haarcascade_frontalface
"Rainer Lienhart and Jochen Maydt. An Extended Set of Haar-like Features for Rapid Object Detection. IEEE ICIP 2002, Vol. 1, pp. 900-903, Sep. 2002"
Implemented by OpenCV (http://docs.opencv.org/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html?highlight=cascadeclassifier)

Tracking:
use Camshift algorithm to track certain area (in our case, the biggest face)

Implemented by OpenCV (http://docs.opencv.org/modules/video/doc/motion_analysis_and_object_tracking.html)

Control:
there are 5 commands to controll our robot: rotate left, rotate right, moving forward, moving backward, stay
